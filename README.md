# PSDokuWiki - Development Branch [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/n4d47tojqr1gcs54/branch/dev?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AndyDLP/psdokuwiki/branch/dev)

PSDokuWiki is a (WIP) PowerShell wrapper module for DokuWiki's XML RPC API, this also functions as my test bed for learning various powershell techniques.

## How to install

(Recommended) [From the powershell gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSDokuWiki "PSGallery page")

```powershell
Install-Module -Name PSDokuWiki -Repository -PSGallery -Force
````

(Not recommended) You can also clone this repository and copy the .\PSDokuWiki folder to one of the module folders

## How to use

I am changing this away from using a "DokuSession" object to be more in line with other remote connection type cmdlets (such as VMWares Connect-VIServer / Connect-HVServer). As such I will aim to have it function like the below (still WIP)

```powershell
# Connect to the API
Connect-DokuServer -ComputerName 'wiki.example.com' -Credential (Get-Credential) -ErrorAction 'Stop'

# Add text to a page contained in the API / on the server we connected to earlier
Add-DokuPageData -FullName 'ns:page' -RawWikiText 'Hello World'
````
